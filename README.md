# HIV1-Drug-Response-Prediction

This machine learning-based script predicts changes in infection severity among HIV-1 patients. This is achieved by analyzing the sequence and potential markers of the HIV-1 Reverse Transcriptase (RT) and Protease (PR). The goal is to classify patients into two outcome classes: 1 for those with improved status and 0 for others, based on the individual shifts in viral load (VL) and CD4 count (number of white blood cells in 1 mL of blood).
